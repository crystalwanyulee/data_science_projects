In this project I have utilized non-parametric survival analysis methods such as Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test to see how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I also implementd Random Forest to accurately predict the probability of a customer churning and deployed a model using flask web app.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and userâ€™s tweets (Content-based filtering).

The objective of this project is to analyze the data of 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users to analyze customer purchase pattern and most popular products. I also performed customer segmentation and affinity analysis for better marketing, Cross-selling, and Upselling.

In this project, I have employed various regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based ensemble regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. I have implemented and optimized XGBoost using GridSearchCV that yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.
