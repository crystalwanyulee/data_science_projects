This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. All projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Purpose: Understand customers' attitudes toward the business 

Methods: Naive Bayes Algorithm, Machine Learning

Results: Applied the algorithm I built from scratch and gained F1 score to 77%. Identified 20 important words for classifying positive and negative words.

**Purpose:** Discover insights from the status quo

**Method:** Descriptive Statistics, Cohort Analysis, Visualization

**Result:** Strategies works very well after August and increasing the retention rate is indeed helpful to raise revenue.

* - **Purpose:** Identity current customer groups 
  - **Methods:** Conducted feature engineering by RFM analysis and grouped customers by K-means

**Results:** Recognized 5 consumer groups &mdash; VIP, Loyal, Casual, Novice and Probably Dead &mdash; and found sales heavily relies on a few customers, which probably is a potential risk for the business.





In this project I have utilized non-parametric survival analysis methods such as Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test to see how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I also implementd Random Forest to accurately predict the probability of a customer churning and deployed a model using flask web app.

In this project, I have employed various regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based ensemble regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. I have implemented and optimized XGBoost using GridSearchCV that yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.
